        This website is a portfolio for myself along with a wide range of various tools that I actively use for my special interests/hobbies. Areas with sensitive tools will require authentication/login 
        before you can enter as I don't want the general populus to have access to these tools. After login, if you don't have the permissions to use them you will still be able to view them in a disabled state
        for demonstration purposes.
